# Mind Over Matter (Mind/Matter)

### An event company, specializing in organizing and promoting live electronic music events, specifically melodic techno. 

One of my side interests is live electronic music, specifically in the genres/sub-genres of house, deep house, tech house, techno, melodic techno. 

Mind/Matter has organized several successful events and we aren't just stopping in the United States. I enjoy seeing the result every time an event takes place, look forward to adding more contributions to the site, and contributions to ensure the team has as many resources as they need to bring top-tier experiences to all our patrons.
